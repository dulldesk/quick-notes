# quick-notes
Chrome extension to take quick notes. Also functional in Mozilla Firefox.

# How to install
As this extension is not on the Chrome Web Store, it is to be installed via Chrome's `Extensions` page.
1. Clone the repo via https://github.com/dulldesk/quick-notes.git or download the zip file via https://github.com/dulldesk/quick-notes/archive/master.zip .
2. On your Chrome browser, navigate to <ins>chrome://extensions</ins>.
3. Enable `Developer Mode`
4. Click on `Load Unpacked`
5. Select the repo folder (`quick-notes` if the repo was cloned or `quick-notes-master` if a zip was downloaded)
6. A new icon will appear on the top bar. Enjoy!

Upon restart of Chrome, a popup will appear about disabling developer extensions. Note that *quick-notes* will be installed as a developer extension, hence the reason for the popup. Unless otherwise concerned, it can be disregarded.
